# Traffic Analysis with Machine Learning

## Overview
Applies machine learning to predict traffic conditions (**Low, Medium, High**) based on factors like weather, traffic lights, and vehicle data.

## Features
- Cleans and preprocesses traffic data.
- Trains multiple machine learning models.
- Evaluates model performance using accuracy scores.

## Installation
1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook trafic.ipynb
  ```
- Run all cells to preprocess data and train the model.
- View model accuracy and predictions.

## Dependencies
The notebook requires:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

To install manually:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
